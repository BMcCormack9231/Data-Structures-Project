# American State Capitals - Java Program

This Java program is an academic project aimed at familiarizing oneself with different data structures in Java. It explores sorting arrays and manipulating data using HashMaps and TreeMap.

Description
The program is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Sorting Arrays
Objective: Sorting a 2D array containing US states and their capitals alphabetically by capital name using Bubble Sort.
Functionality:
Displays all US states and their capitals sorted by state name.
Rearranges the list to be sorted by capital name using Bubble Sort.
Provides a quiz-like interface where the user can enter state capitals to test their knowledge.

Part 2: Sorting & Searching HashMap
Objective: Converting the array data into a HashMap and then sorting it using the TreeMap class. It allows users to search for a state and get its corresponding capital.
Functionality:
Converts the 2D array data into a HashMap.
Displays the states and capitals stored in the HashMap.
Enables users to input a state name to retrieve its capital from the HashMap using a TreeMap for efficient search.
